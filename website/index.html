      <small class="text-muted">The Pokemon franchise began with a pair of video games, Red and Green, in 1996 and has since become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time.
        Despite the 24-year mark since its emergence, it is still just as popular with a total of 8 generations in its games that are published every 3-4 years.
        It has evolved several generations of kids and adults alike with its engaging storylines and challenging battles.</small></h2>
        <h2><small class="text-muted">With the everlasting fans of the franchise, Pokemon World Championships are still being held every year.
          However, after two decades, the debate of the which Pokemon is the best has still not been resolved.</small></h2>

          <h2><small class="text-muted">
            As a generation that has grown with Pokemon games ourselves, we have noticed the lack of data visualizations on battle performance and body style online.
            Moreover, the existing visualizations looked outdated and non-engaging.
            Therefore, in this project, we aimed to fuse all the Pokemon data for fans like us and create a fun, holistic, and interactive guide. Enjoy! </small></h2></div>

                            Let’s say the reader is interested in poisonous Pokemon and wants to get insights on the related diversity of Pokemon across generations as well as the capabilities and aesthetic possibilities for such Pokemon. First off, the reader might want to focus on generation 1 as 14% of the most present abilities are poison-related while it does not exceed 6% for the other generations. It is confirmed in the aesthetic comparisons as 19% of the most present body shapes and colors are related to poisonous Pokemon. With that being said, the reader might end up with a purple Pokemon as it is present in 51% percent of the poisonous Pokemons cases. Body shapes are petty much uniformly distributed for that category.

The reader can also chose a specific generation as well as a curve shaped display to better apprehend how many Pokemons are left for each pattern. The figure is also made so that the reader can change the order of feature display by shifting them up and down upon dragging, as well as changing feature value upon left and right draggin as well. Moreover, feature value can also be displayed by size or alphabetical order upon clicking on the respective toggle “size” and “alpha” after hovering on the feature.

                                Finally, it is time to put it all together. As abilities and esthetics are important for Pokemon choice, they are not the only features that matters. In fact other categorical ones such as health points (hp), attack points (attack), special defence (sp_defence) and so on exist and provide quantitative informations on Pokemon’s behaviour in combat as well as other general characteristics. Hence, it is important to investigate the different patterns across those features among the Pokemons for the 6 available generations. In fact, some readers might only want to focus on such categories for there Pokemon choice. Highest hp and special attack, with a low likelihood of encounter (low capture rate) have proven to be important features in public choice. For that, the following coordinate visualization will provide answers to the reader in many ways.

Such selection will make the figure display the Pokemons name and patterns fitting such range of values. The number of displayed Pokemons is shown on top of the figure. Hence, it is also possible to compare Pokemon distribution for a given subset of values across generations.
                                The order of features can be changed as well upon left and right click and drag on the feature of interest.

                                          With that being said, it is time to find our poisonous Pokemon. To chose between the remaining options, we select the possible body types in the first generation and look for the best pattern in terms of attack (above 90) and rareness (low values, capture_rate less than 50). Quadrupled and bipedal_tailed seem to match such conditions giving respectively Venusaur and both Nidoking and Nidoqueen for the bipedal_tailed.
